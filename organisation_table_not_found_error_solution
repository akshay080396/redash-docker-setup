This error occurs when the Redash application starts but cannot find the organization table in the PostgreSQL database. 
The root cause is typically that the database has not been initialized with the required schema and tables during the initial setup. 
Redash relies on these tables to store metadata and operational data.

-Start an interactive shell session inside the redash_server container:
docker exec -it redash_server bash

-Once inside, locate the manage script:
find / -name manage

-Inside the container, initialize the database by creating all required tables with:

python manage.py database create_tables

This command uses Redash's internal management scripts to set up the database schema, including the organization table.

-Once done, exit the container with:
 exit
